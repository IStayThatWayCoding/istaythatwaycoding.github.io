My GitHub account is called "IStayThatWayCoding", where I store all of my projects that I can access on my devices. I like to add everything to Github to show all of my coding projects.
I created this repository, called istaythatwaycoding.github.io to fulfill the requirements of this assignment, with a README file in it, containing this information.
I used Github desktop (already installed) to clone and go into the file explorer to the Github folder to edit this file in Visual Studio Code.
